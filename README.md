LBL

LBL calc - hydroacustic array UTM beacon position calcSimple program for finding coordinates for 
HiPAP LBL (long baseline) transponders used for DP reference systems. Designed for ultra deep water 
drilling operation. All coordinates are in UTM - Universal Transverse Mercator geographic system. 
Ideal for use with HiPAP/HAIN reference systems (High Precision Acoustic Positioning/Hydroacoustic 
Aided Inertial Navigation) based on cNode transponders. (SPT/MPT beacons are up to 700m water depth). 
Please choose radius of beacon circle, just remember as rule of thumb is recommended that radius is 
between 15% and 20% water depth.
Program is calculating pairs on mN/mE for array 2x5 beacons, 2x4 beacons and 2x3 beacons. 
First column in bearing, second Northings and last Eastings.
This layout will will pretty much allow you to use any BOP heading without transponder being in shadow zone.
